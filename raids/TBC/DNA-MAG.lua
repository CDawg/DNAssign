PLEASE NOTE: If you modify the instance dropdown boss names and call for the msg packet, it MUST not have a space.
The compressed network packets will read as "LavaPack" and not "Lava Pack".
All of this is because Blizz uses LUA which is a fucking piece of shit garbage code from hell and whoever invented it needs to get his nuts cut off!
