The raid should be well prepared and have players assigned to various locations in the room around C'thun, ensuring an even distribution of players at max distance from one another, to avoid doubling and tripling the damage from Eye Beam, and setting the raid up for an easier rotation around the room during Dark Glare.\nDuring Phase 2, damage dealers should be looking to do\nas much damage while in C'thun's stomach as they can before receiving too much damage and having to leave the stomach. If any damage dealer is inside the stomach, they should communicate how much health the remaining Flesh Tentacle has, ensuring they wait to kill it until the raid is in position and all adds have been cleaned up around C'thun, so the raid can focus target C'thun when the Carapace goes away.\n\nTanks\nThe entire raid has to have impeccable positioning during Phase 1, to\navoid deaths from Eye Beam and Dark Glare.
